# Record Automation: Record Your Actions with Ease
## What is the Record Automation feature?
Record is a feature on Hidemyacc Automation designed to streamline the process of creating automation scripts by recording your actual manual actions.
​
With Record Automation, you only need to perform manual actions once to create precise, fast, and efficient automation scripts. The Record feature captures your real-time actions on websites, including mouse actions (such as scrolling through a news feed, clicking menus, viewing products, liking posts, etc.), keyboard inputs, and typing speed to generate similar automation scripts. 
## How to use the Record feature to create automation scripts? 
To use the Record feature, navigate to Automation and select the Record icon.

​
A new Hidemyacc profile will be created with a randomized size. To start recording your actions, click the Record button.
​
**Please note:** The Record feature is applicable only on web pages; actions outside of the page, such as opening new tabs, URLs, clicking bookmarks, etc., will not be recorded.
​
*For instance,* if you want to create an automation script for Google searching a specific keyword, you can access **Google.com >> click Record >> Type the keyword >> Press Enter.** The automation script will be equivalent to the following commands:
1. New tab <Google.com>
2. Click element 
3. Type 
4. Keyboard 
​
To initiate script creation, open the desired webpage, click Record, and start performing actions. Hidemyacc will guide you on creating a simple automation script on Twitter using this Record feature.
​
First, visit the Twitter page and log in to your account. This script involves actions like scrolling through the newsfeed, following users, and interacting with their posts.
​
Press Start to begin recording.

​
Next, follow the script's actions:
1. Scroll through the newsfeed: Scroll slowly to ensure an accurate recording of your actions.
2. Click on Search to find a user by username. **Note:** Click precisely on the Selector; incorrect selections may lead to random clicks within the selected area.

​
10. The automation script will be saved in the form of commands. You can edit the script content. The system will use standard selectors from the web; double-check to ensure the correct selector is chosen.

​
11. To check if the selector is standard for the web, copy the selector from the automation script, go to Twitter, right-click, select Inspect, click on Element, and press Ctrl+F to paste the selector into the search box.

## Note when using Record Automation Feature
**Note 1:** The Record feature can only be used on the website; actions outside the page will not be recorded. Examples include opening new tabs, entering URLs, clicking bookmarks, typing in the toolbar, and so on. 
​
*For instance,* if you want to create an automation script for Google Search, you need to navigate to Google.com first, then press Record, type the search term, and press Enter. 
​
The automation script will consist of commands such as New tab, Click element, Type, and Keyboard. Wait commands can also be added based on the page load time.
​
**Note 2:** You should wait for the website to finish loading before proceeding with subsequent actions.
​
**Note 3:**  Ensure you use the correct selector; clicking the wrong selector will render the automation script unexecutable. Therefore, after saving the script, if you are unsure whether you clicked the correct selector, double-check it on the website where you performed the actions.
